** Working on it **

** Necessary **
- test purification
- chatbot does not remember previous messages
- mardown tables are not properly rendered when in response
- ~~Strikethrough~~ not properly rendered in response and prompt
-
    > This is a blockquote
    > It can span multiple lines
    > And contain other formatting like **bold**

    does not span multiple lines

** Secondary **
- edge case: while the response is loading, you hit "cancella"
- answer that is generating does not force user to the bottom of the page
- on mobile the markdown for code overflows
- more readable font for code
- less margin on mobile to see more text
- Attach images
- Attach files
- Button to stop generation (if you don't like it)
- Button to copy the code part of a response
- Remove any reference to a dark theme
- focus on text area immediately after sending message instead of waiting for the response to be completed
- "&copy" in resulting html. Probably have to consider all possible html escape sequences.
