** Working on it **

** Necessary **

- 
- on mobile the markdown for code overflows, instead it should stay in the margins of the normal chat bubbles and be able to be scrollable.
- more readable font for code
- clean up comments

** Secondary **

- Attach images
- Attach files
    - may have to change to responses api
- Button to stop generation (if you don't like it)
- edge case: if, while the response is loading/being streamed, the "cancella" button is hit, then it should also stop the generation
- Button to copy the code part of a response
- user should be able to write a prompt while the answer is generating, for it to be sent later, and the text area should be focused right after sending the message
- when you have a single long word it overflows instead of wrapping around
- cancella does not eliminate the text in the input text area
